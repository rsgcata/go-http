# Improvement Suggestions for Go-Migrations Library

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here are several areas where the go-migrations library could be improved:

## 1. Enhanced Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Add godoc-style comments to all exported functions and types
- **Migration Examples**: Provide more examples of common migration patterns (schema changes, data migrations, etc.)
- **Advanced Usage Guide**: Document advanced use cases like handling large migrations, rollback strategies, etc.

## 2. Error Handling and Reporting
- **Structured Errors**: Implement structured error types for better error handling by consumers
- **More Descriptive Messages**: Some error messages could be more descriptive (e.g., in cli.go line 47: "coult not bootstrap cli" has a typo and could be more specific)
- **Error Context**: Add more context to errors to help with debugging

## 3. Concurrency and Locking
- **Optional Locking**: While the README mentions no locking is done intentionally, providing optional locking mechanisms would be helpful for users who need it
- **Distributed Locking**: Consider integrating with distributed locking solutions for clustered environments
- **Advisory Locks**: Implement database-specific advisory locks where supported

## 4. CLI Enhancements
- **Interactive Mode**: Add an interactive mode for running migrations
- **Dry Run**: Implement a dry-run feature to preview migration changes
- **Migration Status**: Enhance the status command with more detailed information
- **Colorized Output**: Add colorized terminal output for better readability

## 5. Testing Improvements
- **Integration Tests**: Add more integration tests with different database types
- **Benchmarks**: Add benchmarks for performance-critical parts
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure high test coverage for all components

## 6. Modern Go Patterns
- **Context Usage**: Expand context usage throughout the codebase for better cancellation support
- **Generics**: Consider using Go generics for type-safe operations where applicable
- **Error Wrapping**: Use error wrapping consistently throughout the codebase

## 7. Configuration Options
- **Config Files**: Support configuration via files (YAML, JSON, TOML)
- **Command-line Flags**: Add more command-line flags for configuration
- **Environment Variable Prefixing**: Allow customizing environment variable prefixes

## 8. Logging and Observability
- **Structured Logging**: Implement structured logging for better observability
- **Log Levels**: Add configurable log levels
- **Metrics**: Add optional metrics for monitoring migration performance and status

## 9. Migration Templates and Generators
- **More Templates**: Provide templates for common migration patterns
- **Custom Templates**: Allow users to define custom templates
- **Code Generation**: Enhance code generation capabilities for migrations

## 10. Advanced Features
- **Dependency Between Migrations**: Support dependencies between migrations
- **Parallel Migrations**: Allow running independent migrations in parallel
- **Versioning Schemes**: Support different versioning schemes beyond sequential numbers
- **Migration Hooks**: Add pre/post migration hooks for custom logic
- **Transaction Support**: Enhance transaction support for databases that support it
- **Schema Validation**: Add optional schema validation before/after migrations

## 11. Database Support
- **Expanded Database Support**: Add support for more databases (SQLite, Oracle, etc.)
- **NoSQL Support**: Enhance support for NoSQL databases beyond MongoDB

## 12. Developer Experience
- **Better Error Messages**: Improve error messages for common mistakes
- **Migration Scaffolding**: Add commands to scaffold new migrations with boilerplate code
- **Migration Visualization**: Add tools to visualize migration history and dependencies

These improvements would make the library more robust, flexible, and user-friendly while maintaining its core simplicity and focus on Go-based migrations.
